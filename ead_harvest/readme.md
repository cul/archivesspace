# rbml-archivesspace/ead_harvest

 * **ead_oai_harvest.py**: script to harvest a set of EADs from ArchivesSpace, based on lookup of BibID from local source. It uses ASFunctions.lookupByBibID, but could instead use a different lookup function (no API calls required, only OAI feed.)
 * **ead_api_harvest.py**: script to harvest a set of EADs using the API, based on lookup of BibID from local source. Requires ASFunctions.py.
